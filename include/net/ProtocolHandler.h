 * and higher-level game events. WSClientThread owns a reference to this interface
 * and calls its methods from the network thread.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * All methods (on_connect, on_message, on_disconnect, flush_outgoing) are called
 * exclusively from the WSClientThread's background thread — never from the main
 * thread or UI thread. They are never called concurrently with each other.
 * Implementations that interact with shared game state must synchronize access
 * (e.g. via EventChannel, mutex, or main-thread dispatch).
