 * the asset is pinned in memory -- the cache will not evict it even if it is
 * the least recently used entry. Eviction only targets assets where
 * use_count() == 1 (i.e. only the cache itself holds a reference).
 *
 * This mirrors the legacy client's "keep warm while in use" behavior.
 * Transition/one-shot assets are naturally evicted once callers release them.
